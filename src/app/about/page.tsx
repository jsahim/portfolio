      <p className="text-white text-xl">I have dedicated over 12 years to providing exceptional client service in the technology and marketing fields. I possess a strong work ethic paired with excellent analytical and organizational skills.<br/><br/> As a natural progression for my career in tech, I enrolled in the Turing School of Software & Design and completed their immersive Front End software engineering program. This engineering program specialized in UX concepts as well as coding languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React framework. <br/><br/>Shortly after receiving my Accredited Frontend Software Engineering Certificate, I accepted a position of Content Developer & Designer working in the hospitality tech industry. For the past 2 years, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to design, develop and implement new product features in an Agile environment. <br/><br/>I am now seeking a new position which leverages my previous work experience, client service experience, recent education and passion for UX development to create accessible, user-centered software.</p>
