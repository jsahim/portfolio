      <p className="text-white text-xl">I have dedicated over <strong>12 years</strong> to providing <strong>exceptional client service</strong> in the technology and marketing fields. I possess a strong work ethic paired with excellent analytical and organizational skills.<br/><br/> As a natural progression for my career in tech, I enrolled in the <strong>Turing School of Software & Design</strong> and completed their immersive <strong>Front End software engineering</strong> program. This engineering program specialized in <strong>UX concepts</strong> as well as coding languages such as <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React</strong> framework. <br/><br/>Shortly after receiving my Accredited Frontend Software Engineering Certificate, I accepted a position of Content Developer & Designer working in the hospitality tech industry. For the past 2 years, I collaborated with <strong>cross-functional teams</strong> to design, develop and implement new product features in an <strong>Agile environment</strong>. <br/><br/>I am now seeking a new position which leverages my previous work experience, client service experience, recent education and <strong>passion for UX development</strong> to create accessible, <strong>user-centered software</strong>.</p>
